# Hyprland Waybar Taskbar

This config is designed for **Waybar on Hyprland running on Arch Linux**.
- Hyprland-specific modules will not work on other compositors.
- Paths may need adjustment on non-Arch systems.
- Other distributions may require installing Waybar and dependencies manually

Keep both `config` and `style.css` in `~/.config/waybar`.

If the directory does not exist, create it first:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/waybar
